<h2>No formal peer review</h2>

<span class="text_big">
The LittleSis team is constantly keeping an eye on the data pulled in from our bots as well as the work of our analysts.

However, LittleSis is not uniformly peer reviewed; while users may correct errors or engage in casual review, they have no legal duty to do so and thus all information read here is without any implied warranty of fitness for any purpose or use whatsoever.
